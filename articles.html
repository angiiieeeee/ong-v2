                  Trump’s First-Day Executive Orders Spark Human Rights Concerns
                </h3>
              </div>

              On his first day in office (January 20, 2025), U.S. President
              Donald Trump issued executive orders that, according to Human
              Rights Watch, threaten human rights. The measures include
              restrictions on refugees and asylum seekers, expedited
              deportations, the removal of protections for transgender
              individuals, tougher immigration processes, and the U.S.
              withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreements. Foreign development
              aid was also paused, impacting human rights defenders. HRW warns
              that these policies erode freedoms and pledged to continue
              demanding accountability.º

                  Sudan: Fighters Rape Women and Girls and Subject Them to
                  Sexual Slavery
                </h3>
              </div>

              RSF fighters and allied militias have raped dozens of women and
              girls in South Kordofan, Sudan, since September 2023, including
              cases of sexual slavery. Human Rights Watch documented multiple
              testimonies from survivors and witnesses describing gang rapes,
              murders, and abductions. Some women were held in slavery-like
              conditions for months. These crimes, which violate international
              humanitarian law, could constitute crimes against humanity. HRW
              urges the UN and the African Union to take immediate action to
              protect civilians and ensure justice for the victims.

                </h3>
              </div>

              Break Isolation Group, part of International Women* Space, is a
              refugee-led initiative in Germany addressing the systemic
              isolation and oppression faced by asylum seekers, particularly
              queer individuals. Asylum policies force refugees into restrictive
              "lagers," exacerbating social exclusion and exposing queer people
              to further risks. The group provides peer-to-peer support,
              community-building through activities like shared meals and
              retreats, and advocacy against oppressive measures such as
              restricted financial aid and limited mobility. Their work pushes
              for systemic change, including the abolition of "lagers,"
              recognition of climate refugees, and policies prioritizing dignity
              and autonomy for all asylum seekers.

                  Gaza Strip in maps: How 15 months of war have drastically
                  changed life in the territory
                </h3>
              </div>

              Fifteen months of war have devastated Gaza. The conflict began
              after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed
              1,200 people. Israel’s response has left over 46,600 Palestinians
              dead, vast destruction, and nearly all of Gaza’s 2.2 million
              people displaced. Infrastructure has collapsed, poverty is nearly
              universal, and food insecurity is widespread. The UN warns
              rebuilding could take decades, with water, sanitation, and
              healthcare systems in ruins. Despite a ceasefire, recovery remains
              uncertain.
